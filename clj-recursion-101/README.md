# Recursion 101

In this course from `purelyfunctional.tv`, I've learned about the concept of recursion and how to implement some already known functions only using recursion, like `map`, `filter` and `length` in `Clojure`.

Also, the course teaches how to use recursion with and without the tail call optimization using recur + loop.
